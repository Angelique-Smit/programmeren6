**Webservice with a front and backend, using Nodejs/Express, Mongo DB/Mongoose and React**
NOTICE: Make sure to have Node installed since this webservice needs NodeJS to run.

**Install:**
Make sure you you run
        $npm install
in both directories (front- and backend)

**Add your own mongo DB databse in the index as mine is not in use anymore. All you need to do is change the link to the databse **

**How to run:**
After adding in your own database of mongoDB, open your terminal and run the following command:
        $npm run dev
This will make the backend on the node server start working.

Now you can open the index page on the front end and use the app.
